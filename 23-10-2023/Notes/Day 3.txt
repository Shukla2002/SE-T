1) Syntax	:  Syntax refers to rule that define structure of language

	#include<stdio.h>

	int main()
	{

	}

	# -> pre define

	include -> to add something
	
	stdio.h -> standatd input output header file



2) Tokens : 

		Something meaning of particular group

	There are six type of tokens in c language

	1) Keywords
	2) Identifier
	3) Constant
	4) Strings
	5) Operators
	6) Punctuator




	1) Keyword : Key word means reserve word that word has something meaning 

			keyword are written in small letters

		there are 32 types of keyword 
		e.g.

		for,while,break,if,else e.t.c.

	
	2) Identifier : identifier is name used to identify variable,functions or any user defined item

		e.g. int a = 1;

			a is identifier of 1 value

	
	3) Constant : Constant are fixed value in programme we can not change it value 

		const (data type) (variable name) = value
		
		const int a = 12;

		const float pi = 3.14;


	4) Strings :  string means is Set of character null character at the end of the string

		WORD : H	E	E	L	O	\0

 		INDEX:0		1	2	3	4	5

	
	5) Operators : An operator is symbol to perform mathemetical or logical operations


		e.g +,-,=

	6) Punctuator : Punctuator are used as part of synatx

		e.g {},(),#,e.t.c 


	

2) Data type : Data types refers value which type of value we store in identifier

		if we store value 10 in a identifier c the value of 10 is integer so we must use data type int

		e.g int a =10;
		    char a = "ar";
		    float = 3.54;
		    double = 3.546;
		    long double = 3.6542
		    

3) Control and looping structure : Control structure means control something based somehing condition

		following type of control structure

		1) if
		2) if else
		3) else if
		4) nested if 
		5) switch
		6) nested switch 

	
		syntax :  

			if (condition)

			{
				statment;
			}			 			 



			else 
			{

				statment;

			}

1) Algoritham : 

		An algoritham is a set of well defined instructions to solve the problem. it takes input from user and give desirable output.

2) Flowchart :

		An idea is expressed on picture of diagram is prefered to text from by people.in some time algoritham is complex and difficult to follow as in algoritham there are few steps repeat again and agin tht's why use of flow chart in pictorial form
